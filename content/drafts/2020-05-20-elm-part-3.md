# Virtual DOM

# Basic applications

Exposing (..) exposes everything within the module Html
First list is a list of attributes for the element
second argument is a list of elements inside the element

```elm
import Html exposing (..)

main =
  div
    []
    [
      text "Hello!"
    ]
```

```elm
import Html exposing (..)


main = div []
  [ button [] [text "-"]
  , div [] [text "0"]
  , button [] [text "+"]
  ]
```

## Basic Elm Architecture

Model View Message Update

### cycle

[ model ] -to generate-> [view] -can generate-> [messages] -are passed to the function-> [update] -which updates the [model]

### example

```elm
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)
import Browser exposing (sandbox)


initialModel = 0

view model = div []
  [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [text "-"]
  , div [] [text <| String.fromInt model]
  , button [ onClick Increment] [text "+"]
  ]

type Message = Increment | Decrement

update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment ->
      model + 1
    Decrement -> model - 1

main = Browser.sandbox
       { init = initialModel
       , view = view
       , update = update
       }
```

### main function

Check possibilities listed under Browser module

# Commands

The interaction we saw above is just between the user interacting with the view, and the view generating messages which are used to update the model. But usually a web application does other kind of itneractions like request to a server API. This are done via Commands.

```elm
import Browser
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing (..)
import Http
import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, field, string)

\-- MAIN

main =
  Browser.element
    { init = init
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    , view = view
    }

\-- MODEL

type Model
  = Failure
  | Loading
  | Success String

init : () -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
init \_ =
  (Loading, getRandomCatGif)

\-- UPDATE

type Msg
  = MorePlease
  | GotGif (Result Http.Error String)

update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    MorePlease ->
      (Loading, getRandomCatGif)

    GotGif result ->
      case result of
        Ok url ->
          (Success url, Cmd.none)

        Err _ ->
          (Failure, Cmd.none)

\-- SUBSCRIPTIONS

subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  Sub.none

\-- VIEW

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div [] h2 [][ text "Random Cats" ]
    , viewGif model
    ]

viewGif : Model -> Html Msg
viewGif model =
  case model of
    Failure ->
      div [] text "I could not load a random cat for some reason. "
        , button [ onClick MorePlease ][ text "Try Again!" ]
        ]

    Loading ->
      text "Loading..."

    Success url ->
      div []
        [ button [ onClick MorePlease, style "display" "block" ] [ text "More Please!" ]
        , img [ src url ] []
        ]

\-- HTTP

getRandomCatGif : Cmd Msg
getRandomCatGif =
  Http.get
    { url = "<https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&tag=cat>"
    , expect = Http.expectJson GotGif gifDecoder
    }

gifDecoder : Decoder String
gifDecoder =
  field "data" (field "image_url" string)

```

The signature of the update function should be like this in order to execute a command each time the model is changed. So it will return a tuple with a Model and a Command to be executed.

```elm
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
```

Look for more about this.

# Subscriptions

Like listeners on some event.

The above is an example of using commands. Look at the main function definition where it defines a possible subscription. In this case is kind of doing nothing. But if you want to subscribe to some kind of event and send a command according to that event you should do something there.

The subscriptions function signature will be something like this

```elm
import Browser
import Html exposing (..)
import Task
import Time

\-- MAIN

main =
  Browser.element
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }

\-- MODEL

type alias Model =
  { zone : Time.Zone
  , time : Time.Posix
  }

init : () -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
init \_ =
  ( Model Time.utc (Time.millisToPosix 0)
  , Task.perform AdjustTimeZone Time.here
  )

\-- UPDATE

type Msg
  = Tick Time.Posix
  | AdjustTimeZone Time.Zone

update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Tick newTime ->
      ( { model | time = newTime }
      , Cmd.none
      )

    AdjustTimeZone newZone ->
      ( { model | zone = newZone }
      , Cmd.none
      )

\-- SUBSCRIPTIONS

subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  Time.every 1000 Tick

\-- VIEW

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  let
    hour   = String.fromInt (Time.toHour   model.zone model.time)
    minute = String.fromInt (Time.toMinute model.zone model.time)
    second = String.fromInt (Time.toSecond model.zone model.time)
  in
  h1 [][ text (hour ++ ":" ++ minute ++ ":" ++ second) ]

```

So from the example above, you can see the subscriptions functions where it accepts a model as parameter and depending on the event listened it sends a Message with the value got from the event listened. In this case is listening to an event which is sent by the Time.every function which on each second will send a Message with the current datetime as parameter.
