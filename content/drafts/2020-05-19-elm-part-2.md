This guide will:

Teach you the fundamentals of programming in Elm.
Show you how to make interactive apps with The Elm Architecture.
Emphasize principles and patterns that generalize to programming in any language.
By the end I hope you will not only be able to create great web apps in Elm, but also understand the core ideas and patterns that make Elm nice to use.

If you are on the fence, I can safely guarantee that if you give Elm a shot and actually make a project in it, you will end up writing better JavaScript code. The ideas transfer pretty easily!

A delightful language for reliable webapps.

 Nothing else nothing more. But with the 

# Values
## String
"hello" Doble quotes
"hello" ++ "world" concatenation

## Numbers

All integers except you spcifi is a float number

```elm
>1
1

> 1+2*4
9
```

# Functions

name list or arguments separate with spaces equals body

```
divideByTwo n =
  n / 2
```

no side effects

no return statement, funal calculation is function result
is able to infer types depending on the operations inside the function

You can define the type definition with function signature

before the function

```elm
divideByTwo: Float -> Float
divideByTwo n =
  n / 2
```

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

main = text (divideNumber 5 135)

divideNumber divisor dividend = String.fromFloat ( dividend / divisor)
```

Piping to the right

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

main = text (divideNumber 5 135)


divideNumber divisor dividend = dividend / divisor |> String.fromFloat
```

Piping to the left

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

main = text (divideNumber 5 135)


divideNumber divisor dividend = String.fromFloat <| dividend / divisor
```

Parametrize functions with currying setting parameters partially

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

main = text (divideNumber 5 135 ++ " is " ++ divideBy5 135)


divideNumber divisor dividend = dividend / divisor |> String.fromFloat

divideBy5 = divideNumber 5

```

# If expressions

```elm
isFactor dividend divisor =
  if rem dividend divisor == 0 then
    True
  else
    False
```

Attention! All statements should return same type

# data structures

## list

Kind of array, but all items of same type.

```elm
primes = [ 2 ,3 ,5 ,7]
```

https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/List

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

toString: any -> String
toString any = Debug.toString any


funWithLists =
  let
    myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  in
    myList |> toString

reverseList =
  let
    myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  in
   List.reverse myList |> toString


buildResult  =
  "This list "++ funWithLists ++ " reversed is like this " ++ reverseList

main = text buildResult
```

## tuples

Set of values, but can be different types. A tuple can hold two or three values, and each value can have any type. But Tuple helper library just has two helpers to retrieve first and second elements. As it is indicated that for more complex type of data use the record data type.

```elm
calculationResult = (True, 42)
```

```elm
import Html exposing (text)
import Tuple

toString: any -> String
toString any = Debug.toString any


funWithTuples =
  let
    myTuple = ("First", 2)
  in
    toString myTuple


somethingUseful =
  let
    result = (True, "The result")
  in
    if (Tuple.first result) then
      "Success: " ++ Tuple.second result
    else
      "Failure" ++ Tuple.second result

main = text somethingUseful`
```

## record

Kind of object, with the label and value

```elm
point = { x = 4, y = 14 }
```

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

toString: any -> String
toString any = Debug.toString any

main =
  let
    point1 = { x = 1,  y = 2 }
    point2 = { x = 5, y = 10 }
  in
    distanceBetween point1 point2 |> toString |> text

distanceBetween p1 p2 =
  ( ((p1.x - p2.x)^2) + ((p1.y - p2.y)^2) ) ^0.5
```

But if you try to define signature of this function you we'll figure out to how to define a type. We can use type alias

```elm
type alias Point =
  { x : Float
  , y : Float
  }
```

Look at the convention here to put the comma in front of each new line

```elm
import Html exposing (text)

toString: any -> String
toString any = Debug.toString any

type alias Point =
  { x : Float
  , y : Float
  }


main =
  let
    point1 = { x = 1,  y = 2 }
    point2 = { x = 5, y = 10 }
  in
    distanceBetween point1 point2 |> toString |> text

distanceBetween: Point -> Point -> Float
distanceBetween p1 p2 =
  ( ((p1.x - p2.x)^2) + ((p1.y - p2.y)^2) ) ^0.5
```

Attention.
We can define local variables inside a function in the let block.

```

```
