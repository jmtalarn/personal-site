# Install Elm

You require Node.js and NPM to be installed on your computer. Check it by running in your command line
Check about how to install Node and NPM [here](https://www.google.com)

If you want it globally install with npm like this

```bash
npm install -g elm
```

If you prefer you can install it locally by doing

```bash
npm install --save-dev elm
```

But if you check the log there, you will see this message. So if you want you can avoid npm at all.

```log

Downloading Elm 0.19.1 from GitHub.

NOTE: You can avoid npm entirely by downloading directly from:
<https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases/download/0.19.1/binary-for-mac-64-bit.gz>
All this package does is download that file and put it somewhere.

From Elm Tooling

1. Install VSCode from here
1. Follow this link to install the plugin
1. Make sure you have nodejs and therefore npm installed
1. Make sure you have Elm installed
1. Install elm-test and elm-format by running npm install -g elm-test elm-format in a terminal

- Why do I need to install elm, elm-test and elm-format?

You will need to install elm and elm-test to get all diagnostics and elm-format for formatting. If your setup fails to find the global installations of those, you can use the settings panel in VSCode to set the paths to the executable manually. Alternatively you can also just install these to your local npm package.json.

- Can I use an elm-analyse config?
  Yes, you can, please check here for more details.

# Configuring VSCode to work with Elm

My preferred editor is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and these are the extensions I use to work with Elm.
